### Project Description

 A website where we can upload our outfit pics and then an generates suggestions 

### The Problem statement
Every day, countless women face the challenge of deciding what to wear, ensuring they maintain variety while avoiding outfit repetition. A common preference is that an outfit worn on one day should not be repeated the next, with a rotation spanning a week or even two, depending on the available wardrobe.
The process of selecting an outfit can be time-consuming, especially when considering factors such as color coordination, weather conditions, and suitability for different occasions (such as school, college, or the workplace). With a growing number of clothing options, manually tracking previously worn outfits and planning future ones becomes difficult.

### The Solution

We propose Wardrobe Genie, a smart wardrobe management website that helps users effortlessly plan their outfits. The platform allows users to upload pictures of their outfits, and an AI-powered system generates suggestions for what to wear next while ensuring variety and avoiding repetition.
